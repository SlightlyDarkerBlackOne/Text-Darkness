"With both palms on the wall, you feel your way around the room. The walls are cold and damp. Something you think might be old dried up paint is crumbling to the touch and sticking to your hands. You keep going until you come to the first corner of the room, as well as accidentally kick something with your foot. **==SFX: wooden hit.==** “There’s something there. Like a wooden object.” You keep exploring. 

"There's the second corner. Then the third. Your pores start to open as you realize the angle of the upcoming wall leads you to the start. There might not be any openings. **==Sanity drop==** Fear starts to crawl up your spine, but after a few more steps between the third and the fourth corner of the room, the texture changes. **==Sanity recovers==** ”Wait, this is different! It feels like a ==metal panel==… A rusty ==metal panel==. It might be a door, but I should be careful how I touch it. The last thing I need is a tetanus countdown.""

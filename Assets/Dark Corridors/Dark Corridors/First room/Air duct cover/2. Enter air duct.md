"“God, please don’t let me get stuck and die like a rat in this terrifying hole. That's one of my worst nightmares. Thanks."”

"You wait for another moment for God to receive the message."

"As your belly hits the floor, you begin to crawl and enter the **==air duct==**." 

**==SFX: crawling and scraping==**

"Fighting the ever-looming panic that seems to be housed in this air duct, you proceed to crawl forward. As you collect age old dust and cobwebs, the air smells stale and sweet, then, you notice that the path splits. The path **==forward==**, and another, to your **==left==**." 

"“Where do I go now? I’m barely orienting myself as is. Do I just pick randomly?”" 

"You ponder your next move."

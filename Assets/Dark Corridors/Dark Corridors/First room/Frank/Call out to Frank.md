"Seeing how your options are limited, you quickly call out before the footsteps leave for good and you're again left alone in the dark."

"“Hey, over here, behind the **==door==**! I’m trapped! Please, help me!”"

"You hear a quick shift of gravel under their feet as if catching them off guard. They pause for a moment, then finally speak out."

"???: "Ah, I knew I heard someone sniveling. Didn't think it'd be a trapped rat.""

"The low, raspy voice seems to belong to a male. Shady at best, sinister at worst."

“"I can’t get out, I don’t know where I am and I can’t see a thing. Please.”"

"???: "Give me something of **==value==** and I might help you out.""

"He doesn't seem friendly, either."

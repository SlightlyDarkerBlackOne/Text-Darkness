"result":
"His **==leg==** is knee deep in your **==room==**, locked in an awkward position in the **==doors opening==**. All you have to do is pull it in one direction and it should…" 

"???: “No, what are you doing?! Let me go, LET ME–”" 

**==SFX: bone snap/crack/dislocation==**

"???: “AHHH! AAAAAH! UNGHH! MY LEG, YOU BROKE MY LEG, UGHHHH! Let go of me, LET GO! I’ll… I’LL KILL YOU!”"

**==SFX: Some crazy creature sound, walls shaking==**

"“What was that?”"

"A sound you’ve never heard before in your life shakes the very walls that surround you. Soon, further sounds, movement, a sickly glow."

"???: “NO! What have you done?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!!! LET ME GO! IT’S GOING TO GET ME!!! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!! (wimpers) Please, please don–”" 

**==SFX: more screams, crunches and blood==**

"Suddenly, his whole **==leg==** gets pulled from out your grasp with monstrous strength in an instant. The sounds that follow can only be explained as nightmarish at best."

"“W-W-What is that? I’ve never heard anything like it. It’s not an animal, definitely not human. Fucking shit, what is this fucking hellhole?!"”

"The gruesome noises continue, the sickly glow flickers, until it all stops. And then, nothing. Again the darkness, again the silence."

"You remain motionless and breathless for a few minutes. Listening intently and gazing at a black canvass. But nothing happens."

"After calming down a bit, you realize that - though with blood on your hands - you learned several key information."

"1. You're not alone, there's probably more people trapped and/or lost like you."

"2. There's something unknown or even unnatural roaming around, preying - killing."

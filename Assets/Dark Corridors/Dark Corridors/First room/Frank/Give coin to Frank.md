"result":

"You stretch your hand through the **==door's crack==** and offer the **==coin==** to the stranger. As the person reaches to pick up the **==coin==** resting on your open palm, they brush their fingers across it. You immediately notice them being worn out - cracked nails and arid skin. The person snatches the the **==coin==** with intent. No, not intent. Something more akin to greed and desperation."

"???: "Ha-haha-HA! I never thought I’d get one as easily as this.""

"“So it’s worth a lot?”"

"???: "Oh, it’s worth much more than that.""

**==SFX: steps walking away==**

"“Hey, where are you going? Let me out first!”"

"???: "Why should I? You’re useless to me now.""

""WHAT?! You said we had a deal!”"

"???": "And you trust a stranger in the dark without ever seeing their face? Don't worry, I’ll make more use of it than you ever could.""

"“No! NO! Come back! Please! I…”"

"“I’ll help you! It’s easier if there’s two of us, right?”"

"???: "You’re not worth anything. I don’t need a gullible mouth to feed. Just stay there and die quietly. It's for the best.""

**==SFX: banging on door==**

""You son of a bitch! FUCK YOU! I’ll rip you apart when I find you!""

"Ignoring your threats, the person leaves. You can hear their footsteps getting further and further away."

""I swear to fucking Christ, when I get out of here I'll break all of his wrinkly, evil, fucking fingers...""

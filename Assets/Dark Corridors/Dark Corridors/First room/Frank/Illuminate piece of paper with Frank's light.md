"You take the **==piece of paper==** out of your pocket and hold it under the **==light==**. Trying to blink away the needle-like prickles in your eyes, you focus on what you can. Immediately, you can tell it’s not a normal **==piece of paper==**. It’s a **==photograph==**. And as the white blur takes shape, a circle appears. No, a symbol. A ring? A fruit? It looks like a circle with several asymmetric dots inside its radius, but the image is poor in quality."

""Now I know it's a picture, but of what? Better hold onto it for now.""

"“AH, FUCK!”" 

"Though rusty and old, the **==door==** refused to give in and in the process cuts your **==left palm==**. You’re bleeding slightly."

"“Fucking great, I can’t even see how deep it is! Ugh, doesn’t feel too bad. It’ll probably stop by itself, but a **==bandage==** would still be nice.""

As you start pulling at it with full force, you can feel the sharp metal edge digging into your palms, but the **==bandages==** buffer them well enough for you to keep going. The metal creaks louder and louder, until..."

**==SFX: breaking off a metal shard==** 

"You rip off a part of the rusty **==door==** itself."

""Good, now that hole is bigger, still not enough to crawl through it. The **==shard==** seems useful, though.""

"result":

"It’s basically a thin piece of rusty metal on worn out hinges and locks, you feel confident in your ability to kick down the **==door==**.“

""Always wanted to do this, though, I was imagining a breakable, splintery, wooden door and not this metal monstrosity. (sigh) Wouldn’t be fun otherwise.”" 

"After making triple-sure you’re perfectly facing the **==door==**, you steel yourself and charge at it with full force."

**==SFX: Inhale - Couple of footsteps - Loud metal bang - Door crashes or something cracks==**

"To only your surprise, the **==door==** gets ripped from its hinges with a dumbfound ease. Snuggly pressed onto the metal plate, flying through the air, you realize, only half the effort was needed. You manage to say one word midair..." 

""Fuck."" 

The door crashes wildly onto the floor, along with you. Producing a bang that rings out in two directions, left and right. The sound is so heavy it’s as if your eardrums have just been punched by air."

"“Ouch...""

""At least I’m out and I’m pretty sure I’m in a hallway. Though for how long it stretches, it’s hard to say, it's still pitch black. I’m making a mental map.”"

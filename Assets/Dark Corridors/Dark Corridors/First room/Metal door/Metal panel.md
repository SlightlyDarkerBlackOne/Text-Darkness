"Gently you follow the edges of the panel, it’s about the size of a door. One of its corners seems to be protruding towards you. It is a ==door==. You keep pressing and poking areas you think might have a knob, a keyhole, any type of mechanism that might give you further insights. But there are none. No mechanism, no handle, no opening other than the ==dent in the door’s corner==. “It has to be a door. But it must be locked from the other side. What the fuck is going on? I’m not as dumb as to get myself accidentally locked up in a place like this. Which means… I was brought here? Was I kidnapped?! Shit, is this some kind of torture-death game organized by some freak or rich fuckers? Or both? Nah, unlikely. That shit only happens on TV.”"

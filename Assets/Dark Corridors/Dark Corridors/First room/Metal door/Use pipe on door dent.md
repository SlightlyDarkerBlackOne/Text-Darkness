"result":

"“Perhaps I could wedge the pipe in the **==door's dent==** and pry it open."”

"And that’s exactly what you do. It fulcrums nicely against its own frame. You begin to apply pressure. The **==door==** creaks, and the metal bends, soon with little effort, a ==piece of the door== around the **==dent==** breaks off with a clank. The **==hole==** is much bigger now. Not enough for you to fit through completely unfortunately."

"requirements": item_metal_pipe and metal_panel

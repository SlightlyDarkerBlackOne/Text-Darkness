"Somewhat fearfully, you place your open mouth under the incessant droplets above you. Scared it might be poisonous you brace for the worst. As soon as the first drop hits your parched tongue, your body instinctively knows that it’s drinkable **==water==**. Even better than what you normally have at home. You rehydrate yourself fully, wash away a fraction of your maladies (dirt, cuts, psychological dmg), but as soon as you satisfy one of your primal needs a new thought sets in. 

"“This **==room==** is almost a ruin, I can’t imagine the rest of the building to be any better. So how come there’s drinkable water still? And not only that, it tastes almost natural. How old is this place?”"

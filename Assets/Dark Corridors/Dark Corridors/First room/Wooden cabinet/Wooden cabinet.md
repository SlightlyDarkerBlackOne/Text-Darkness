"You lower your hands towards the unknown object in front of your feet. With open eyes looking at nothing, you try identifying it by feel. About waist height, you come into contact with it. The top is a wooden plane, covered in dust and rough particles. The object has sides and a base. Then you notice several handles in the front. “It’s like a cabinet with drawers. Wonder what’s inside.”"

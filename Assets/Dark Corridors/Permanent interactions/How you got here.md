"“I was watching the news, trying to inebriate myself to sleep, but I haven’t left the house in days and my stash was well and dry. I took the **==house keys==**, though, have I locked the **==door==** on my way out? Anyway… Went for more booze. Whiskey. Haven’t had that in a long while. Bounced off of things on my way to the 24/7. Got there. Took two bottles and a six-pack, just in case. And then I went home. No, wait. I… Took a walk? I think… Yes, I was going down the alley and then… Sirens? I don’t know, I was piss drunk. Couldn’t differentiate what’s flashing outside or inside my head. And then… Ahh, I can’t remember. Now it’s as dark inside my head as is outside of it. I’m dehydrated. If I could get some **==water==** I’d sober up quicker. I’ll remember more.”"
